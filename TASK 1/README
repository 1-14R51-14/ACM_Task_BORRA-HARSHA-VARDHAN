Task is to build an Unsupervised Learning Model on a Dataset(Clustering Model).
I chose K means Clustering algorithm as the Unsupervised Model and Iris Dataset to train and test the model 
I checked which properties of the species formed good clusters and selected those properties
Then , I applied K means algorithm and then checked its accuracy .
