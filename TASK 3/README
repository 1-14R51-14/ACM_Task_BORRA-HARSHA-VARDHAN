Task is to build a Basic Deep Learning Network for Binary Classification
I have choosen cancer classification dataset for this task .
Our goal is to predict the type of tumor the patient has by analyzing his/her symptoms.
I have done some preprocessing (cleaning the data)
Then I built the deep learning ANN model with 600 epochs
Then I saw overfitting of the data , So did "Earlystopping" and reduced the number of epochs
Then I checked its accuracy and evaluated the results.
