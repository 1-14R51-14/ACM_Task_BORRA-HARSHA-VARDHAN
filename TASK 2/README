Task is to build a Classifier or Regressor from Scratch and compare it with Standard Libraries.
I have taken Iris dataset for this task
I have taken "KNN" as the CLassifier to build from scratch and checked its accuracy
I have used basic libraries like numpy to build it.
Then I also built a "KNN" model using standerd libraries and checked its accuracy
Then I compared both of their accuracies and made a conclusion
